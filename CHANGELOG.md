# Release History

## 1.0.0-beta.12 (2021-04-13)
Azure Communication Calling iOS SDK version `1.0.0-beta.12`.

### New features
- `DeviceManager` instance can be obtained irrespective of `CallAgent` creation.

### Breaking changes
- Added `Nullability` annotations for parameters in delegate methods, properties and return types in init. This removes for e.g. the need for the application to force un-wrap objects created by the SDK where applicable.
- Delegate method signatures renamed to confirm with Swift guidelines. Similar to [UIApplicationDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate).
- Block `CallAgent` creation with same user.
- `IsMuted` event is added to the `Call` class. Event will be triggered when the call is locally or remotely muted.
- Multiple classes properties/methods renamed:
   - `Call` class:
       - Property `callDirection` renamed to `direction`.
       - Property `isMicrophoneMuted` renamed to `isMuted`.

    - `VideoOptions` class:
       - `LocalVideoStream` property is now `LocalVideoStreams` making it an array.
       - The constructor for `VideoOptions` now takes an array of `LocalVideoStream` as parameter.

- `RenderingOptions` has been renamed `CreateViewOptions`.

- `startCall` and `join` API's on `CallAgent` are now asynchronous.

- Mandatory to pass completion handler block for all async API's.
